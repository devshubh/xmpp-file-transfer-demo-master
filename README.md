File Transfer using XMPPFramework
=================================

This application is merely a brief demo of how to use the file transfer extension of the XMPPFramework.

A detailed blog post can be found [here](jonathonstaff.com/blog/tackling-file-transfers-with-the-xmppframework/).

My changes have been merged into the master branch of the [XMPPFramework](https://github.com/robbiehanson/XMPPFramework), so you'll want to include the latest version in your project.

Both incoming file transfers and outgoing file transfers are functional within this demo, but I've left a significant amount of error-handling out, so you'll want to include that in your app.

Server Settings
===============

In order for SOCKS5 to work properly, your server must be configured to handle proxy connections.  I've only tested this using **ejabberd**, but these are the `mod_proxy65` settings I used:

```
{mod_proxy65,  [
     {ip, {0,0,0,0}},
     {hostname, "myhostnamehere"},
     {port, 7777},
     {access, all},
     {shaper, c2s_shaper}
]},
```

If you're unable to get the proxy functioning, you always have the option to set `disableSOCKS5 = YES`, which will force an IBB transfer instead.  This is slower, but it's very widely supported.

Usage
=====

Incoming File Transfers
-----------------------

Instantiate a new `XMPPIncomingFileTransfer`, activate it, add a delegate, and wait for a file transfer request.

```objc
_xmppIncomingFileTransfer = [XMPPIncomingFileTransfer new];
[_xmppIncomingFileTransfer activate:_xmppStream];
[_xmppIncomingFileTransfer addDelegate:self delegateQueue:dispatch_get_main_queue()];
```

Responding to `disco#info` queries and the like are handled for you.  You'll get a delegate call when an SI offer is received, at which point you can decide whether or not you wish to accept.  You can also set `autoAcceptFileTransfers = YES` and you won't need to call `acceptSIOffer:` yourself.

```objc
- (void)xmppIncomingFileTransfer:(XMPPIncomingFileTransfer *)sender
                didFailWithError:(NSError *)error
{
  DDLogVerbose(@"%@: Incoming file transfer failed with error: %@", THIS_FILE, error);
}

- (void)xmppIncomingFileTransfer:(XMPPIncomingFileTransfer *)sender
               didReceiveSIOffer:(XMPPIQ *)offer
{
  DDLogVerbose(@"%@: Incoming file transfer did receive SI offer. Accepting...", THIS_FILE);
  [sender acceptSIOffer:offer];
}

- (void)xmppIncomingFileTransfer:(XMPPIncomingFileTransfer *)sender
              didSucceedWithData:(NSData *)data
                            named:(NSString *)name
{
  DDLogVerbose(@"%@: Incoming file transfer did succeed.", THIS_FILE);

  NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory,
                                                       NSUserDomainMask,
                                                       YES);
  NSString *fullPath = [[paths lastObject] stringByAppendingPathComponent:name];
  [data writeToFile:fullPath options:0 error:nil];

  DDLogVerbose(@"%@: Data was written to the path: %@", THIS_FILE, fullPath);
}
```

Outgoing File Transfers
-----------------------

To start a new outgoing file transfer, simply create an instance of `XMPPOutgoingFileTransfer`, activate it, add a delegate, and send your data:

```objc
_fileTransfer = [[XMPPOutgoingFileTransfer alloc] initWithDispatchQueue:dispatch_get_main_queue()];
[_fileTransfer activate:[self appDelegate].xmppStream];
[_fileTransfer addDelegate:self delegateQueue:dispatch_get_main_queue()];

NSError *err;
if (![_fileTransfer sendData:data
                       named:filename
                 toRecipient:[XMPPJID jidWithString:recipient]
                 description:@"Baal's Soulstone, obviously."
                       error:&err]) {
  DDLogInfo(@"You messed something up: %@", err);
}
```

The following delegate calls when get invoked when appropriate:

```objc
- (void)xmppOutgoingFileTransfer:(XMPPOutgoingFileTransfer *)sender
                didFailWithError:(NSError *)error
{
  DDLogInfo(@"Outgoing file transfer failed with error: %@", error);

  UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Error"
                                                  message:@"There was an error sending your file. See the logs."
                                                 delegate:nil
                                        cancelButtonTitle:@"OK"
                                        otherButtonTitles:nil];
  [alert show];
}

- (void)xmppOutgoingFileTransferDidSucceed:(XMPPOutgoingFileTransfer *)sender
{
  DDLogVerbose(@"File transfer successful.");

  UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Success!"
                                                  message:@"Your file was sent successfully."
                                                 delegate:nil
                                        cancelButtonTitle:@"OK"
                                        otherButtonTitles:nil];
  [alert show];
}
```
